Address book application
Requirement specification
Write a simple application using a development framework of your choice (unless
otherwise specified) that does the following:
1. Register as a new user: This allows a new user to register with the following
fields First name, Last name, Username, Password.
2. Ability for an existing user to login: The users that have already registered, as
a user on the site should be able to login with their username and password.
3. Address book maintenance: The application should allow the registered users
to maintain an address book for their contacts. This will include the following
information:
a. First name
b. Last name
c. Address
d. Phone number
4. Geocoding and address validation: The application should carry out a simple
validation against the Google maps API to validate the address entered by the
user and also receive the details associated with the address such as the
accurate street, city, state, postal code, geo-coded location (latitude & longitude)
5. Google street view: When looking at a contactâ€™s address that has already been
added to the application, the page should show the picture as captured by the
Google street view. Please use the Google Maps API to produce this as well.
6. Walk-score: When looking at an address that is already added to the
application, the walk-score of the address should be fetched and displayed as
well. Please view http://www.walkscore.com for details. You will have to register
for a trial developer account to be able to do so.
